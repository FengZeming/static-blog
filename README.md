My github pages blog powered by react.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Usage
1. Run `npm install`
2. Write your article in `.md` format in 'root/posts' directory. And use YAML header to define article information. E.g:
```
---
title: hello world
date: 2018-1-13 17:40:00
category: Daily
---
And your blog content goes here...
```
3. Run `npm run init` to init posts info
4. Run `npm run build` to build app
5. Set Master branch /docs directory as GitHub Pages source
